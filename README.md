# webpack-tutorial

Everyone has a problem with configure Webpack 4. Webpack was definitely complicated and<br>
misunderstandable for me at first sight. I started looking for how to do it, and I found<br>
a million tutorials online, so you probably have seen a thousand different ways to configure<br>
Webpack file. I wrote an article about it(I know how to set up Webpack 4).<br>
